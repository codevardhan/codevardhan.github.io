      <description>‚ÄúA crash is just a high-speed landing&amp;hellip; in the wrong place.‚Äù ‚Äì Unknown RL Agent&#xA;üöÄ Landing Rockets and Losing Our Minds: A Reinforcement Learning Journey By Harshavardhan Manohar &amp;amp; Nivedita Shainaj Nair&#xA;üß† Prologue: It Started With a Rocket We wanted to land a rocket. Not in real life, of course, that would‚Äôve been wildly over budget for two grad students, but in a 2D simulation. Our project was supposed to be a &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; application of reinforcement learning, something nice and contained.</description>

      <description>Introduction I first came across Manim while watching 3blue1brown. His videos were really helpful to help understand some of the key concepts behind machine learning, statistics and the like. The animation engine he uses is also striking, or rather, the way his animations subtly help him explain vivid concepts really stuck with me. I came across a community managed version of his package here: Manim.&#xA;While working with Manim is rewarding, the framework‚Äôs steep learning curve and its general-purpose nature can make implementing specific use cases challenging.</description>

      <description>EazyPredict - Running and comparing multiple ML models at once Welcome to the world of &amp;lsquo;EazyPredict&amp;rsquo;, a Python module that aims to make trying out multiple prediction algorithms as simple and efficient as possible. The module was heavily influenced by the &amp;lsquo;LazyPredict&amp;rsquo; module. I developed this module to address a few shortcomings I identified in LazyPredict.&#xA;Why EazyPredict? Some of its key features are as follows -&#xA;The &amp;lsquo;EazyPredict&amp;rsquo; module utilizes a limited number of prediction algorithms (10) in order to minimize memory usage and prevent potential issues on platforms such as Kaggle.</description>

      <description>The aim of this blog is to guide individuals in comprehending the methodology and tactics required to construct a web scraper.&#xA;The problem with low resource languages for NLP When getting started with an NLP project, the initial bottleneck is always acquiring relevant data. This issue is magnified when trying to work on an NLP project for Indian languages. Some of the challenges associated with building an NLP project for languages with a low digital presence are as follows.</description>

      <description>In this blog we go through the kNN algorithm logic, implement it from scratch in python and apply it on the MNIST digit dataset&#xA;Prerequisites machine learning, supervised vs unsupervised ML, classification vs regression&#xA;Introduction The K Nearest Neighbour classification is a simple and efficient machine learning model that can used for classification. While there are more complex classification models, if establishing a model with some training dataset is proving troublesome, it is likely that a kNN algorithm will provide the best solution.</description>
