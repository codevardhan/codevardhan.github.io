      <description>Chrome Extension To Monitor Mental Health Introduction This project was a really interesting one that I was fortunate enough to be a part of! We made as an entry project to compete in a hackathon organised by HackOn. We did not win the hackathon, but we did create a unique and interesting project. (imo)
Our project aims to monitor a user&amp;rsquo;s search patterns and use this information to inform their close/loved ones about potential mental health problems the user might be facing.</description>
