      <description>EazyPredict - Running and comparing multiple ML models at once Welcome to the world of &amp;lsquo;EazyPredict&amp;rsquo;, a Python module that aims to make trying out multiple prediction algorithms as simple and efficient as possible. The module was heavily influenced by the &amp;lsquo;LazyPredict&amp;rsquo; module. I developed this module to address a few shortcomings I identified in LazyPredict.
Why EazyPredict? Some of its key features are as follows -
  The &amp;lsquo;EazyPredict&amp;rsquo; module utilizes a limited number of prediction algorithms (10) in order to minimize memory usage and prevent potential issues on platforms such as Kaggle.</description>

      <description>In this blog we go through the kNN algorithm logic, implement it from scratch in python and apply it on the MNIST digit dataset
Prerequisites machine learning, supervised vs unsupervised ML, classification vs regression
Introduction The K Nearest Neighbour classification is a simple and efficient machine learning model that can used for classification. While there are more complex classification models, if establishing a model with some training dataset is proving troublesome, it is likely that a kNN algorithm will provide the best solution.</description>

      <description>Chrome Extension To Monitor Mental Health Introduction This project was a really interesting one that I was fortunate enough to be a part of! We made as an entry project to compete in a hackathon organised by HackOn. We did not win the hackathon, but we did create a unique and interesting project. (imo)
Our project aims to monitor a user&amp;rsquo;s search patterns and use this information to inform their close/loved ones about potential mental health problems the user might be facing.</description>

      <description>AMFOSS TASKS &amp;ldquo;Success is normally found in a pile of mistakes.&amp;rdquo; - Tim Fargo
If there was ever a point in my life where I felt this quote, it is after I started doing the tasks required for joining the amFOSS club at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.
AmFOSS is an open source club consisting of a few motivated students promoting and contributing to free and open source software. This helps students to learn out of academics and get introduced to the outside world.</description>
